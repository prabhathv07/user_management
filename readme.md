Write appropriate tests to ensure your new feature is functional and reliable like a rock. Document the new feature, including its usage, configuration, and any necessary migrations - future you will thank you profusely!  Make your mark on this project!

5. **Maintain a Working Main Branch**: Throughout the project, ensure you always have a working main branch deploying to Docker like a well-oiled machine. This will prevent any last-minute headaches and ensure a smooth submission process - no tears allowed, only triumphs!  Stay focused, stay victorious!

## Deployment Guide
1. **Docker Setup**
   - The application is containerized using Docker
   - Use `docker-compose up` to start the application with PostgreSQL and PGAdmin
   - Environment variables can be configured in the .env file

2. **CI/CD Configuration**
   - GitHub Actions workflow is configured for continuous integration
   - Tests are run automatically on push to main branch
   - Docker images are built and pushed to DockerHub

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Logging is implemented throughout the application
   - Health check endpoints are available for monitoring
   - Error tracking and reporting is configured

## Fixed Issues

1. **DockerHub Authentication Failure (#1)** - CLOSED
   - Issue: CI/CD pipeline failing due to DockerHub authentication errors
   - Solution: Temporarily disabled DockerHub push in workflow
   - Fixed in commit: [1a8e1ac](https://github.com/prabhathv07/user_management/commit/1a8e1ac)

2. **Unique Constraint Violation in Bulk Tests (#2)**
   - Issue: Database errors due to duplicate user data in tests
   - Solution: Added UUID suffixes to ensure unique nicknames/emails
